# MovieMVC

My MovieMVC project is meant to create a space for people insterested in watching movies via streaming services.  Here, in one centralized location, users can find their favorite movies and where those movies may be streaming.  When I want to watch a movie, I have to research as to how I will be able to watch it, a problem shared by numerous others.  So I decided to use my project as the solution.

MovieMVC provides three primary features to users:

1.) Provides a database of Movie, Genre, and Streaming Service objects for users to view and edit themselves.

2.) Users can use Browse functionality to look through movie listings by specific Genres or Streaming Services.

3.) Users can use Search functionality to find a certain movie they may be looking for.
